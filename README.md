# Astro Cat

__*Please note this project is still in development*__

This is what I have so far (not intended for mobile devices, needs arrow keys) --> https://cadams8238.github.io/Astro-Cat/

Astro cat is a spin off of the classic arcade game: Frogger. Instead of a frog crossing the street, you're a intergalactic space cat traveling through spaaaace. (Sprites have not been added yet, so you'll have to use your imagination...)


I originally set out to build this project for a few different reasons:

1. I wanted to solidify my understanding of **objects** and how to implement **classes** in JavaScript.

2. I'm passionate about game development and wanted to try my hand at it!

3. I wanted to try out p5.js. p5 is a JavaScript library built on top of Processing that makes working with graphics accessible to any skill level. https://p5js.org/

4. I wanted practice designing game sprites and using a sprite sheet.
